# Logging Configuration Plan

This plan outlines the steps to implement logging for the network attack data ingestion script.

## 1. Integrate Logging Library

*   **Goal:** Choose and integrate a logging library.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] Select a suitable logging library (e.g., `logging` in Python).
    *   [ ] Import the library into the script.
    *   [ ] Configure basic logging settings.

## 2. Log Data Ingestion Events

*   **Goal:** Log successful data ingestion events.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] Add logging statements to track when data is successfully written to Datastore.
    *   [ ] Include relevant information in the logs (e.g., entity ID, timestamp).
    *   [ ] Use appropriate log levels (e.g., INFO).

## 3. Log Errors

*   **Goal:** Log any errors encountered during ingestion.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] Add error handling to catch exceptions.
    *   [ ] Log error messages, stack traces, and other debugging information.
    *   [ ] Use appropriate log levels (e.g., WARNING, ERROR).

## 4. Implement Log Levels

*   **Goal:** Use different log levels to control the verbosity of the logs.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] Configure log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
    *   [ ] Use appropriate log levels for different types of events.
    *   [ ] Allow users to configure the log level via command-line arguments.
