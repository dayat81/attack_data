# Data Pipeline Implementation Plan

This plan details the steps to construct the data pipeline for ingesting network attack data into Google Cloud Datastore.

## 1. Define Data Schema

*   **Goal:** Define the structure of data to be stored in Datastore.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] Identify key fields from the network attack data.
    *   [ ] Determine appropriate data types for each field.
    *   [ ] Design Datastore entities to represent the data.

## 2. Implement Data Transformation and Cleaning

*   **Goal:** Prepare the data for ingestion by transforming and cleaning it.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] Implement data parsing logic to extract relevant information.
    *   [ ] Handle missing or invalid data.
    *   [ ] Convert data to the appropriate format for Datastore.

## 3. Develop Ingestion Logic

*   **Goal:** Write data to Datastore efficiently.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] Use the Datastore API to create and update entities.
    *   [ ] Implement batch writing to improve performance.
    *   [ ] Handle potential errors during the writing process.

## 4. Consider Using Dataflow

*   **Goal:** Evaluate the feasibility of using Dataflow for scalable data processing.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] Research Dataflow and its capabilities.
    *   [ ] Determine if Dataflow is suitable for the data volume and velocity.
    *   [ ] Implement a Dataflow pipeline if appropriate.
