# High-Level Plan: Network Attack Data Ingestion

This plan outlines the steps to develop a script for ingesting network attack data into Google Cloud Datastore.

## 1. Identify the Active Google Cloud Datastore Instance

*   **Goal:** Determine the correct Datastore instance to use for data ingestion.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] Verify project ID and Datastore instance ID.
    *   [ ] Confirm the instance is active and accessible.
    *   [ ] Document the instance details for use in the script.

## 2. Construct the Data Pipeline

*   **Goal:** Create a pipeline to efficiently ingest network attack data.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] Define the data schema for Datastore entities.
    *   [ ] Implement data transformation and cleaning steps.
    *   [ ] Develop the ingestion logic to write data to Datastore.
    *   [ ] Consider using Dataflow for scalable data processing.

## 3. Implement Logging

*   **Goal:** Track data ingestion progress and errors.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] Integrate a logging library (e.g., `logging` in Python).
    *   [ ] Log successful data ingestion events.
    *   [ ] Log any errors encountered during ingestion, including details for debugging.
    *   [ ] Implement appropriate log levels (e.g., INFO, WARNING, ERROR).

## 4. Write a README File

*   **Goal:** Provide clear instructions on how to use the script.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] Explain the purpose of the script.
    *   [ ] Describe the required command-line arguments.
    *   [ ] Provide examples of how to run the script.
    *   [ ] Document any dependencies or setup steps.

## Subtasks

*   [ ] Data Pipeline Implementation (may require a separate file)
*   [ ] Logging Configuration (may require a separate file)
